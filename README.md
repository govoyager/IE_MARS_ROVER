This repository contains all the files needed to simulate and build the IE_Mars Rover, a six wheeled Mars Rover robot, using [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/)  and [ROS](https://www.ros.org/).
The software runs only on [ROS noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic) and [Ubuntu 20.04](http://www.releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/). So just be careful with the version of Ubuntu before installing it.

## Installation process

First you have to install [Ubuntu 20.04](http://www.releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/) either on a virtual machine or else you can also duel boot. Then after the installation of Ubuntu 20.04 we need to follow the instructions given in [ROS noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic) website and finish our installation.

Then after installing both [Ubuntu 20.04](http://www.releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/) and [ROS noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic) we can try running a sample file in [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/). 

Now we are finished with the installation part.
